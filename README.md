# Mixtape
a cli for music collection playback management

## Usage
Mixtape-cli is a tool used to create & manage sets of audio tracks. Effectively, the output is a playlist with precision in terms of segmentation, playback speed control, transitions, etc.

The content pool supported will derive from your local files, or the universe of audio within youtube videos. The underlying scraping mechanism is a fork of youtube-dl, therefore the library of content available should match whatever youtube-dl can find.
